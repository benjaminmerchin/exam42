Subjects can be foubd [there](https://github.com/markveligod/examrank-02-03-04-05-06)  
  
<b>(this exam is outdated) Exam Rank 02 / 1st exam of the common core :</b><br>There is two exercises<br>The first one is inter or union (easy)<br>The second ont is gnl (easy with a buffer size of one) or printf (hard)<br>Some people only practice for gnl<br>Roughly 80% of the people validate the exam with gnl

<b>Exam Rank 03 / 2nd exam of the common core :</b><br>There is two subjects<br>They are almost the same (around 10% differences between the two subjects)<br>My personal version is relatively short and simple (130 lines)<br>To train, you have to code your own version and then compare it with [Glagan's test.sh.](https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03)

<b>Exam Rank 04 / 3rd exam of the common core :</b><br>There is one exercise<br>It is a very simple version of the minishell ~120 lines.<br>I took inspiration from [joann8's solution](https://github.com/joann8/ExamTraining/tree/master/exam4).<br>It should be possible to make my version even more compact (~100 lines) by replacing the type in the struct with a boolean in the case of a pipe and therefore removing the define.

<b>Exam Rank 05 / 4th exam of the common core :</b>TODO

<b>Exam Rank 06 / 5th exam of the common core :</b>TODO<br>For the client, we can just use the command Netcat:
```
nc 127.0.0.1 8081     (case with server port 8081)
```
and save the time required to code a client.
